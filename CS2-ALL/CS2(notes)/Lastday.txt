R-value reference. it can only take temp varibles

you can have a move constructor

you can also have a move assignment
(String&&); 

we can have constexpr double = 7.25 * 2;

for *int &x : range) std:: cout << x << std::endl;

auto i = 20;
std::cout << i << std::endl;

c++ is great- fucntional, precedreal, object oriented, fast, lambda
