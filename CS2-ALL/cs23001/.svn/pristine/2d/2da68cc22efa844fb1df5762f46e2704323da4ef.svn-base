Grades are out of 100% - Comments are mostly for why points were taken off.

P1

m1: 95 - all implementations should only be in cpp;
m2: 90 - segmentation faults at end of add.cpp; could use some larger bigint in + test cases; not that many [] test cases;
m3: 85 - make tests doesnt compile -> trying to access private member -> but passes instructor tests; barely any test cases for times10 and digit;

bonus: 


P2

m1: 60 - input tests should really be automated -> grab log files; fails 1st instructor test -> Assertion `str.capacity() == STRING_SIZE-1' failed.; some test files could use a few more, should aim for at least 10 each, except constructors -> like empty strings, special characters, larger strings especially at or near cap, etc;
