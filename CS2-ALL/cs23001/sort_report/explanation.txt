Explanation:
It is the operator function for the vector. There are a few reasons that this function took up alot of time in the algorithm.
The first reason is that the operator was called over a trillon times! It was called many times in the bubble sort program to get 
the index of a vector to move numbers around. For example, for each vector being sorted, it would have to go through the vector many
times to sort each number around. If the bubble sort function is going through the vector many times, and the size of the vector is 100, 
then it could be looking at over a thousand calls.
 
The second reason that it takes the most time is because in the function bubble sort, it will have multiple calls in just one line. 
For example, in the file "sort_lib.cpp" lines 113 and 115, the operator is being called twice on each line, which is also a reason for 
the many function calls. In conclusion, this function took up so much time because of it being called multiple times on one line, and 
this racked up over a trillon calls. This function took almost 45% of the time, which is a really high number compared to the other functions.
